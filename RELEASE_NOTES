R3.15.5-1.0.13.1:	2020-09-08 from R3.15.5-1.0.13 tag
	Applied Add RULES.cpu file and support for convertRelease.pl building cpuEnv.sh with changes for R3.15.5-1.0.13 as requested by Kristi.

R3.15.5-1.0.13: 2018-04-17 from R3.15.5-1.branch
	Applied community patch as follow:
	    patches/epicsGeneralTime.c.diff: epicsGeneralTime.c were made (fetch time provider's eventTime into a local copy) an inconsistency resulted.
	    More details at: https://bugs.launchpad.net/epics-base/+bug/1747091

R3.15.5-1.0.12:	2018-04-13 from R3.15.5-1.branch
	Modify generalTimeGetEventPriority() to allow eventNumber > 256.
		eventNumbers between 0 and NUM_TIME_EVENTS will continue to get checked for advancing timestamps.
		Support for eventNumbers > NUM_TIME_EVENTS will be up to the generalTime provider.
	Revert "Bumped up NUM_TIME_EVENTS to 599 to allow more unused event numbers for TSE timing."
	Fix ECHO definition to not match variables in MAKEFLAGS by using MFLAGS instead.
	Changed a variable name to avoid conflicts w/ old RULES.Restore files in various modules.
	Added errlog() function for cexp and errlogPrintfNoConsole iocsh function
	Cherry-picked M. Davidsaver bug fixes from 3.15
		db: dbGet() ensure long string nil and actual string length
		db: fix dbGet() for attributes as long string
		libCom: revise ipAddrToAscii

R3.15.5-1.0.11:	2018-03-06 from R3.15.5-1.branch
	Updated RULES.archive to support foo.arsubstitutions and foo.arconfig.
	Bumped up NUM_TIME_EVENTS to 599 to allow more unused event numbers for TSE timing.

R3.15.5-1.0.10:	2017-12-08 from R3.15.5-1.branch
	No src changes, just build related.
	Cleaned up custom rules for Restore, alh, archive, and autosave.
	Also made sure *.cmd and *.proto files can be installed via
	CMD += and PROTO +=.
	Default INSTALL dir for both is INSTALL_LOCATION/db, but that
	can be overridden by ioc by redefining INSTALL_CMD and INSTALL_PROTO.
	Sort DIRECTORY_TARGETS to avoid errors if 2 FILE_TYPEs have
	the same INSTALL directory.
	Rework module dependency conflict error message for easier debugging.
		Now a simply grep for asyn in the build log will show you
		line by line which modules depend on which asyn versions.

R3.15.5-1.0.9:	2017-11-16 from R3.15.5-1.branch
	Fix vpath error that broke installing templates via DB += file.template
	Applied rules-ioc-archive-autosave-templated.patch to add support for generating autosave
		and archive request files.
		Also allows building db, autosave, and archive files from ioc directories.
	Fix to block calc input records from inheriting status from themselves via INP* MS

    Applied community patches as follow:
	patches/dbCa-warning.patch: fixes the issue for IOCs with very large numbers of CA links may crash on shutdown due to a bug in the dbCa code.
	patches/fix-1699445.patch: fixes the issue and allows hex constants in some places where they didn't work before.
	patches/RTEMS_rsrv_mcast.patch: fixes rsrv - failed to set mcast loopback in src/ioc/rsrv/caservertask.c.
 
R3.15.5-1.0.6:	2017-08-17 from R3.15.5-1.branch
    Fixed RTEMS targets to USE_GESYS=YES.
	From EPICS R3.15.1 to R3.15.2 a change was added and RTEMS target builds can now be configured to make GESYS modules by changing the USE_GESYS=NO setting in the file configure/os/CONFIG_SITE.Common.RTEMS to YES.

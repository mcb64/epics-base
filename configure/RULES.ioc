#RULES.ioc

include $(CONFIG)/RULES_DIRS

## PCDS moves the buildInstall, envPaths and other targets from
## here, RULES.ioc, to RULES.ioc-targets to allow the ioc-targets to
## be configured w/ or w/o RULES_DIRS
include $(CONFIG)/RULES.ioc-targets

## PCDS rules for building archive and autosave files in ioc directories.
## These rules are needed to install autosave and archive files
## from IOC directories whose Makefile's end like this:
## include $(CONFIG)/RULES.ioc
## -include $(CONFIG)/RULES.archive
## -include $(CONFIG)/RULES.autosave
##
## However, the following style of Makefile works better as it creates
## O.Common and other O.* directories as needed for proper dependency checking
## include $(CONFIG)/RULES
## include $(CONFIG)/RULES.ioc-targets
##

	@echo "Inflating ioc archive file from $<"
